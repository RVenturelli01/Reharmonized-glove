 A sensor-equipped glove turning hand movements into musical notes for effective and enjoyable fine motor skills therapy
# Description
A glove capable of registering the flexing of the fingers and the orientation of the hand and to use these physical quantities to play a large variety of sounds. The selected glove design therefore simply maps different physical parameters characteristic of human hand movements to distinct musical controls, allowing users to have an engaging interaction with the device while executing their motor coordination therapeutic exercises.
